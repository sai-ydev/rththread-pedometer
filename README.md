# RT Thread Pedometer

This is my entry for the RT-Thread OS contest. I got the WCH's [CH32V208 dev board](https://github.com/openwch/ch32v20x/tree/main). 

I wanted to build a pedometer that makes use of the:

1. BLE capability
2. Interfaces the BMI270 accelerometer

I faced quite a bit of challenges in getting off the ground but I managed to interface the accelerometer. 

I couldn't get the BLE working. There is no official BLE support for this board.
