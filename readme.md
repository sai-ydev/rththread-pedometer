This is my entry for the RT-Thread OS contest. I got the WCH's [CH32V208 dev board](https://github.com/openwch/ch32v20x/tree/main). 

I wanted to build a pedometer that makes use of the:

1. BLE capability
2. Interfaces the BMI270 accelerometer

The following items are complete:

1. BMI270 accelerometer interface
2. OLED display interface

The following items are pending:
